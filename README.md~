**Project summary**:
In this project propose a series of mitigation interventions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 outbreak size and probability in nursing homes. We identify a series of rewiring principles that reassigns infected patients to immune healthcare workers while retaining workload balance; this strategy reduces the risk that infections spread from patients to health care workers. We find a ~50% reduction of infections when using this infection and antibody-based cohorting as a weekly intervention.

**Code description**:
All codes are written in MATLAB version R2020a. To plot the figures, you need (1) to run path_setup.m. and (2) run path_setup.m before running other codes.

**Folder descriptions**:
- **Data**: contains the bipartite network 
- **Figures**: contains codes necessary to generate the figures
- **Functions**: contains additional function codes needed to plot the figures: SEIR mdoel, rewiring functions, etc.
- **Doc**: copy of the manuscript
